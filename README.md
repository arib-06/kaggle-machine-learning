## 🔍 Data Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
```python
# Example workflow from notebooks
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score

# Load data
train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Explore structure
print(train.info())
print(train.describe())
print(train.isnull().sum())
```

### Phase 2: Preprocessing
```python
# Handle missing values
train.fillna(train.mean(), inplace=True)

# Encode categorical variables
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
for col in train.select_dtypes(include='object'):
    le = LabelEncoder()
    train[col] = le.fit_transform(train[col].astype(str))
```

### Phase 3: Model Training
```python
# Train ensemble
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

models = [
    XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
]

for model in models:
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
    print(f'{model.__class__.__name__}: {scores.mean():.4f}')
```
